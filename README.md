# Non-domestic-multi-zone-average-usage-profiles-for-Germany
In this repository multi-zone average usage profiles for non-domestic building usage categories in Germany are provided. These multi-zone average usage profiles allow the simulation of single-zone building models while at the same time reduing the "single-zone" uncertainty compared to a multi-zone approache drastically.

The Concept of the typology was first published at the [eceee Summerstudy 2022](https://www.eceee.org/summerstudy/) in a peer-reviewed article, availble in the [proceedings](https://www.researchgate.net).
